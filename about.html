        <p class="texto-sobre">In my childhood I already wanted to understand when I didn't have a mobile phone, laptop and computer until one day had the first Samsung computer of the windows XP operating system.</p>

        <p class="texto-sobre">I remember when I studied through the workbook and analyzed each sequence of how to turn on a computer and access the browser of older versions of windows.</p>
          
        <p class="texto-sobre">I really enjoyed accessing gaming website and some of them were very successful in 2000 until 2009. During my trajectory I thought about several professions, but none liked only technology until my father and mother motivated me, because they believed that I have a talent for technology.</p>
          
        <p class="texto-sobre">For many my presence in this area was crazy because it contains a small part of women who study and work, something that I have heard a lot and that I could not learn anything from these affirmations I never agreed.
        Don't be afraid little by little you acquire a lot of knowledge and this world contains several paths.    
        </p>
          
        <p class="texto-sobre">I am grateful every day for what I do and where I want to go.</p>
